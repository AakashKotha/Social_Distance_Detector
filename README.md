# Social_Distance_Detector
This project will help you to detect social distancing in this COVID-19 situation at your premise. Using technology, more specifically the ML-based, I developed a mechanism, which can be implemented on a video stream of any of the localities. The mechanism distinguishes the people who are following social distancing, and those who are not following.
