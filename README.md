Social Distancing System
-> This code will help you to do social distance detection in this COVID-19 situation at your premise.

-> You can change the social distance threshold in program to make sure it works best for the your camera/input view.

-> If you want to do more improvisation then you can calculate social distance threshold dynamicaly based on human objects size, so it will be more reliable in case of short and long distance view.

Steps to run the code :
1- open command prompt and change directory(cd) to project folder

2- install all the below depedencies,You will need the following to run this code:

 Python,Cython,imutils,numpy,opencv-python,Pillow,PyYAML,six,torch,torchvision
3- For human detection download: yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg files (weights file in not present because of size issue. It can be downloaded from here : https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

4- Put the downloaded yolov3.weights in your project yolo-coco folder

5- Run this code : python social_distance_detector.py --input pedestrians.mp4 --output output.avi
